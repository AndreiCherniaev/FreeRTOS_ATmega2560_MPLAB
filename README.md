# FreeRTOS_ATmega2560_MPLAB
 FreeRTOS Blink simplest example for ATmega2560 on MPLAB X IDE and avr-gcc.
 it based on FreeRTOSv202112.00 and on ATmega328 example for Microchip Studio. 
 It was a little bit problem to import Microchip Studio's project to MPLAB X. I try to use "import" menu of MPLAB X but there are a problems with patch see https://www.microchip.com/forums/m822760.aspx#1209072 Now it works.
